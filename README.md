# Image Run Length Encoding

This project aims to apply the Run Length Encoding (RLE) technique to an image. The goal is to process the image through a series of encoding steps using RLE and then reconstruct it from the encoded data.


## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible Python environment.
2. Execute the notebook cells to run the encoding and decoding steps.
